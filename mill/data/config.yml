# The contents of a Config file are formatted in the same way as that of a
# DataFile with the change that the top-level key must be 'config'.

# This file's parameters are utilized both at package (setuptools) creation and
# runtime.  At present the contents are only related to defaults files, if
# used.
config:
  defaults:
    # If no name is specified the package does not have a defaults file.
    # If specified it is the name of the file in the package source directory.
    name:

    # If no install-dir is specified the defaults file (if used) is installed
    # as package data.
    # If it is specified it is the full path to the directory in which it
    # is installed.
    install-dir: /etc/permabit/python/support
